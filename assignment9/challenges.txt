My greatest challenge during this assignment was handling pagination when  scraping library search results:
    My code was scraping the first page twice and the last (14th) page 0 times.

I thought the problem was in getting the wrong link for the next page.

I also was getting StaleElementReferenceException here and there during scraping each time I run the program.

It turned out problem was using:
    WebDriverWait(driver, 30).until(
        EC.presence_of_all_elements_located((By.CSS_SELECTOR, 'div.results_container'))
    )
after clicking the next page link.

I solved both problems by replacing WebDriverWait with time.sleep(4)
